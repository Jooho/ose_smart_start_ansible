# OpenShift Smart Start Ansible Script
This ansible script is developed for who use Openshift. This project is based on [ose_smart_start](https://github.com/Jooho/ose_smart_start) which is developed by bash shell. Mainly, it contains regression test, sample applications, ad-hoc and so on. Each role can be executable independently and it can be executed in a playbook.
